; Freenet Windows Installer translation template
;
; Quick guide to translating:
; 1.	Save this file as "Include_Lang_xx.inc" (xx being a standard 2-letter lowercase language code, e.g. "en" for English or "da" for Danish)
; 2.	Remove this explanation and add a header with credit to yourself (name, e-mail, websites, etc.) in the header. Look at the other translations to get an idea.
; 3.	Replace "xx" in "LoadLanguage_xx()" below with the same language code.
; 4.	Translate! Format is: Trans_Add("<original text>", "<translated text>").
;	The installer will fall back to English for empty and non-existing string translations, so feel free to translate in small bits.
;	Hotkey letters are prefixed with "&". Feel free to change the hotkey to another letter in your translation - but make sure not to overlap with other hotkeys.
; 5.	If possible, please let another person proof-read your translation.
;	A lot of people are going to read it, and Freenet's creditability is directly affected of the quality of these translations :).
; 6.	Submit your translation to git@github.com:freenet/wininstaller-staging.git or the developer mailing list (devl@freenetproject.org)
; 	Please make sure that either yourself or another developer tests the translation for obvious layout glitches and other bugs
;	(simply launching the installer and verifying that the main GUI looks OK should be enough most of the time)
; 	On the first submission, a developer needs to add the translation to Include_TranslationHelper.ahk in order for the translation to actually be loaded.
; 7.	To keep your translation updated, all you need to do is to download your translation from git (e.g. from http://github.com/freenet/wininstaller-staging/)
;	and check for non-translated strings that has been added since your last submission.
;
; General note about translating the installer:
; Because of the compact, customized GUI design, much of the text are subject to min/max size limitations. A too short translation will leave holes in the GUI and
; a too long will mess up the layout. So try to keep the translations at the approx. same length as the original English text. The easiest way to test the
; translation is to compile the installer and take a look around. The installer compiles and runs under WINE on Linux, but because of WINE bugs the layout will *not*
; be completely equal to running under a real Windows installation.
;
; If you have any questions, please feel free to ask at the developer mailing list (devl@freenetproject.org)!
